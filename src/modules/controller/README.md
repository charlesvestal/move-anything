Turn your Ableton Move into a customizable MIDI controller with 16 banks.

## Features

- 16 independent banks of pad configurations
- Velocity-sensitive pads
- Works with external USB MIDI devices
- Configurable MIDI channel per bank

## Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|

| **Step buttons** | Switch between banks (1-16) |
| **Knobs** | Send MIDI CCs to external devices |

## Usage

1. Select **MIDI Controller** from the Move Anything menu
2. Connect your external MIDI device to Move's USB-A port
3. Press pads to send MIDI notes
4. Press any step button to switch to that bank (1-16)

## Banks

Each bank can have different:
- Base note mapping
- MIDI channel
- Velocity curve

Press any step button (1-16) to switch to that bank. The active bank is shown on the display and highlighted with a white LED on the corresponding step button.

## External MIDI

Connect keyboards, synths, or other MIDI devices to the Move's USB-A port. The controller sends MIDI to all connected devices.

## Tips

- Use different banks for different instruments in your setup
